In a more informed worldview, one that considers how physics actually works, it's paramount to acknowledge that we live in a world of wheels. This means we exist in a world built on the foundational principle that "small" orbits "big," with the smaller object always completing a full cycle around the larger one. This "small orbits big" concept is the foundation of all hierarchy—just look at the nested orbits in solar systems, galaxies, and clusters. The small things act as differentials: little arrows pointing toward the heart of the central object. The big thing, in turn, acts as an integrator, gathering new differentials with its gravitational or magnetic pull. Why God, or whatever force you prefer, designed these to be the foundational architectural rules of our universe, I don’t know. Perhaps other universes are built on alternative frameworks, but this is the reality where we live.

As human beings, we face an issue: we are trapped in an orbit. We all orbit something as differentials. It can be a grand ambition (like developing a theory of everything) or a simple desire (like wanting a new phone). Our minds repeat cycles of thought, and this repetition brings the object of our desire into our consciousness. The more we desire something, the more our mind thinks about it, and thus, the more orbits it completes around it. This principle also applies in physics. The dense objects we interact with are spinning incredibly fast, and the acceleration of an object makes it more material. Our minds, figuratively speaking, spin much slower than a rock because they are nested in a higher dimension of abstraction. For a rock to be present, it has to move fast enough to trick our minds into believing it actually exists. When this reality breaks down, aliasing starts to happen, much like in a video game. You don't want aliasing to happen to you.
But I digress. The fundamental problem—and the foundational hack to reality that explains why some people seem so fortunate—is that you'll almost never get what you orbit. Why? Because the rules of general motion won't allow it. The object of your desire will either absorb you like a black hole, breaking you down into an even lower and more compressed dimension of reality, or it will keep you jailed in a perpetual cycle of desire. The trick is this: if you want something, you must aim higher to reach escape velocity from whatever is trapping you in an expedient cycle of outcomes.

This is the key to understanding why education in computer science seems so worthless when it comes to achieving massive breakthroughs. The best, award-winning ideas are always nature-inspired or borrow concepts from mathematics and physics. Essentially, what I'm getting at is that you won't achieve AGI by thinking like an AI researcher. The rules of the world won't allow it. Look at the team at DeepSeek, for instance: they are all quants. In this world of loops and wheels, you have to aim higher and frame your problem around either consciousness itself or the fundamental rules of the physical universe.

Now, here's what's funny. Following the rules of this game of life, you won't get to frame the universe by thinking solely about the universe. So, what exactly is out there that the universe itself spins around—something that may allow us to achieve a significant, general breakthrough everywhere at the same time?
The answer is, I don't know. But I have my own esoteric spiritual beliefs, and there has been value in that perspective when thinking about new concepts for computing.
Thanks for reading.
