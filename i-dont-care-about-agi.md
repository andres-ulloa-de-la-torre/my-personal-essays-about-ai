In a better informed worldview taking into account how physics actually works, its paramount to address that we actually live in a world of wheels - that means; a world built on the foundation of "small" orbits "big", and small always does a full cycle orbiting along the big thing. "Small" orbits "big" is the foundation of hierarchy (look at the nested orbits in solar systems, galaxies and clusters): the small things act as differentials; little arrows pointing a direction into the heart of the central thing, and the big thing acts as an integrator gathering with it's pull (gravitational or magnetic) new differentials. Why God or whatever, designed this to be the foundational architectural rules of the universe, well i dont know. Maybe other universes are built into alternative frameworks, but it is what is where we live. 

So esentially as human beings we have an issue: we are trapped in an orbit. We all orbit as differentials something: it can be big (i want to make the theory of everything), or it can be small (i want a new phone), and our mind repeats cycles of repetition bringing with this repetition consciousness as to the thing that is desired. The more we desire something the more our mind thinks about it and thus; the more orbits it completes around it. In physics this also applies, as dense objects we interact with, are spinning incredibly fast, and the aceleration of the "thing" makes it closer to material. Our minds spin figuratively speaking way slower than a rock because they are nested in a higher dimension of abstraction: the rock to be present has to be fast and trick our minds into thinking it actually exists. When reality breaks down, aliasing starts to happen. Like a videogame. You dont want aliasing to happen to you.

But i digress. The problem however, and the foundational hack to reality as to how people seem to be really fortunate, is that youll never get what you orbit. It almost never happens. Why? Because the rules of general motion wont allow it. It will either absorb you like a black hole, breaking you down into an even lower and more compressed singular dimension of reality, or keep you jailed in a cycle of desire. The trick is: if you wan't something, aim higher so you reach escape velocity out of whatever it is that is jailing you into an expedient "cycle" of outcomes.

And this is the key to properly understand why education in computing seems to be so worthless when it comes to massive breakthroughs in the field. The best stuff out there that wins prizes is always nature inspired, or borrows something from math or physics. Esentially what im getting at, is that you won't get to AGI by thinking like an AI researcher. The rules of the world wont allow it - look at the team at deepseek for instance: they are all fucking quants. In this world of loops and wheels you have to aim higher and actually frame either consciousness first, or the rules of the physical universe.

Now heres what funny. Following the rules of the game of life, you wont get to frame the universe by thinking about the universe. So whats exactly out there that the universe spins around that may allow us a significant general breakthrough everywhere at the same time?

The answer is i dont know, but i have my own esoteric spirtual beliefs, and there has been value to that thinking about new things for computing.

Thanks for reading.
