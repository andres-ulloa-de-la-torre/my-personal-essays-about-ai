## How bullshit personality frameworks can help you build very nice persona avatars with GenAI


As i said in my previous blog entry; in the current landscape of AI you don't have to believe that personality frameworks are substantially "real" in order to wield them like a tool - i personally dont. Altought among all of them i find vedic astrology interesting because it nests intelligence and the emergence of consciousness as a participatory phenomena where human consciousness is hierarchically shaped by many external ingredients making a trade off between sovereignty and determinism: it has several problems that make it not pass the acid test. For instance the agression signs in western astrology, and the contemplative ones: Scorpio and Aries; against their shadows Libra and Taurus. The biggest mismatch for me with astrology is that the western Scorpios, when oberseved closely do not match at all their signs; (think someone with a birth chart like Katy Perry's): they are social, are not figurativelly "dark" and dense in a sense that they hide their intentions and have trouble stating their inner landscape - IMO they were only call scorpios by greek philosophers because they will proverbially sting you back if you hurt hem. But Libra is called "Libra" after a weighting balance; so in this metaphysical subjectivity they are only getting back at you because they need to "restore" a weight back to where it was originally:  x - x = 0. Thats what Libra in its collective social stask is supposed to do, and its reaction towards achieving this is what has earned them the name "Scorpio". But its bullshit. Thats just one example.

But anyway. Thing is: all this personality frameworks are increidibly amazing with GenAI, because the labs have pretty much scraped the entire internet and that includes all the pop knowledge that exists with regards to what each disposition does: how it reacts in different scenarios, what are their affinities...etc.


A good template to make a GenAI character that leverages this trick, is to specify the system prompt of your personas following a birth chart. Im going to define a character card with almost no personality framework terms, so its more clear how they are casted into mundane language. But if you want to use astrolgical wording, you can perfectly do so and the LLM will understand very well. Like so:


## John Doe

### Personality attributes

**Type**: INTP

**Vision**: Communication, wit and information (Here vision is a different name for the astrology 'sun'; the sun essentially casts light and allows us to interact with the world and _see it_: how we specifically see things from each perspective comes down to our subjetive dispositions. Here i defined vision with the attributes of Gemini)

**Decision making**: Weighting other peoples opinions (Libra Rising)

**Emotions**: Keeps track of his feelings as detailed granular information (Moon Virgo)

**Aggresion**: Will trash things back to step zero and restart everything (Mars in Aries)

**Dreams**: Wants to accumualte wealth (Neptune in Capricorn)

...and so on and so forth for each of the 12 slots of a normal birth chart. For extra depth of character, you can also add the astrological houses. If the LLM is big and a reasoning model, you can even tell the LLM to analyze tensions, and synastries between the personality components, and make a more complex persona.

However for this definition card, theres a lot of information loss because my nouns and verbs are not exactly matching the whole depth of the sign, so its just better to let the LLM do the heavylifting and straight up tell it the sign. You just have to do the previous research and somewhat understand metaphysiscs so you know what you are doing.

Esentially whats nice about astrological signs as data and as root elements for meta description is that they are fundamental in the sense that they are so linguistically loaded that they can act as basis for a lot of emergence.

This is esentially a brief on how you can leverage existing personality framework literature abstracted into every LLM as of right now, to build complex characters.

Thanks for reading.
