Framing gravity is complex yet its mastery suggests an embedding within a good definition for conciousness; we have the harmonic oscillator shaping hierarchies in both atoms and celestial bodies, all of which follow the same spining pattern of a wheel. Humans have to be somewhere in-between, as the union between these two scales: it must as our brains operate following wave principles through spiking neural nets, yet our behavior at grand scale is mostly integrable to specific features as long as the bheavior maps directly into actions where the distributed agreement of what the action is, is realtively common. If you are drinking water, nobody can say otherwise through a bad interpretation - if you are however planning to run for the presidency, theres a lot of projection thats going to happen on what the motiff of your actions are. Theres different densities for human behavior, and light physical actions are a the top where as the fabric of intersubjectivity is at the bottom in absolute most prominent density. Anyway, as years passed i ponderated frequently on the nature of electromagnetism, and if it the distinction between four natural forces even made sense at all. Magnetism to me semeed exactly to be the same thing as gravity, but "pointing in a slightly different direction".

The more i though about it the more i started to diverge from the classical treatment - franlky speaking, the interpretable nature of the MLP as it revealed itself to me, with its capacity to provide a body for the entire world if enough "weight" was provided, achieved all of this with just four basic motion operators, which composed themselves into more complicated forms of "wave superpositon". The wave nature in neural nets is only present in training, which is a disastrous limitation. But i digress.

Esentially, in the universe you get dillation, and you get contraction - the famous ying-yang. When a particle is dilated, it becomes a wave: when it comes contracted it becomes pointlike - like a little ball. Gravity seems to be a contraction, as it accumulates and gathers mass towards spheres, and its natural non interactive opposition being thermodinamic dispersion - which at the grand scale of things takes the shape of dark energy. Magnetism is a non interactive cousin of gravity; they fulfill similar roles, but they dont interact, and electricy seems to be its interactive opposition. Basically the electrodinamic wave which gives manifestation to a composed more complex particle ( the photon)  is the oscillation between the magnetic field and the electrical field. Following the suggested symmetry then what about the oscilation between dark energy and gravity? What more complex physical phenoma does it produce?

The answer i think is somewhere in the obscure echelons of our understandment of dark matter - if light is the forward propagation of action moving a relative frame forward in time, then it most follow that its symmetric opposition must communicate action backwards in time. As far as i can tell, if we ever discover time travel towards the past, instead of slinging around massive bodies like blackholes to jump towards the future, it will defintely have something to do with this dichotomy. At least thats what i think. But anyway. The quantum field theory efforts towards unveiling the interaction between particles and gravity suggest that the fundamental framework by which gravity manifests iteself at the microscale is spin-networks. Esentially wires connecting elements when the wave collapses and becomes point-like.

Its frankly amazing to think it this way, because then you get an idea on how quantum entanglement is threaded and how spin-gravity-networks seem to be distantly related with MLPs. The "weight" here is simply routing the desired measureable outcome at some other region of the MLP; by corrupting its own state with a belief which propagates forwards and backwards, threading together a compatible route of weights pointing in compatible directions that all account for a figurative "data-highway" thats not quite a straight line through the network, but has enough loops to make data transition along different curves so it gets at the end with topological features transfered unto it. MLPs thought about as simply linear algebra and matrix multiplciation are the disgusting machination of an alineated mind - they really shouldnt be taught at graduate school this way.

But anyway. The weights esentially are little quantifiers that emulate gravity and cluster data towards specific topologies that at grand scale are mannifold and probably sphere-like, and at small scale are like laberynths. The transformer esentially adds a better routing mechanism to the "little spheres" that inhabit the networks architecture by organizing the net into indexed "hierarchies of masses" - like a relational database or an indexed phone-book: esentially the transformer block is simply computing metric distances to route data to the most compatible amalgamation of data-mass. 

Under this understandment, implementing a transformer block with just prompting and natural language terms is really straight forward.

Thanks for reading.
